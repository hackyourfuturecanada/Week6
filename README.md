Complete the following assignment on JavaScript 1 and push your file to GitHub for reviewing by the instructor. 

For all the following exercises create one .js file. Separate the questions using comments.

1. **Write a console.log statement saying "Hello World!" for each language that you know.**

For example:

Halo, dunia! // Indonesian

Ciao, mondo! // Italian

Hola, mundo! // Spanish

2. **Consider the following code:**
```
console.log('I'm awesome');
```
Copy the code in your .js file and run it. You will see that you will get a SyntaxError. Find a solution for this error. Hint: read the error message carefully, it also gives an indication of where the problem is.

3. **Declare a variable age and initialize it with an integer, using these exact steps:**

    1. First, declare your variable age (do not initialize it yet).

    2. Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of age is

    3. Add a console.log statement that logs the value of age.

    4. Now initialize your variable age with an integer.

    5. Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of age is.

    6. Add a console.log statement that logs the value of age.

Example steps for question 3:
```
  // TODO -> here you declare your variable
  console.log('the value of age will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
  // TODO -> log the actual value of age
  // TODO -> here you initialize your variable
  console.log('the value of age will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
  // TODO -> log value of age again
```
4. **Declare a variable name and assign a string to it.**

    1. Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.

    2. Now console.log the variable name.

    3. Now assign a new string to the variable name.

    4. Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.

    5. Now console.log name again.

Example steps for question 4:
```
  // TODO -> here you declare AND assign your string
  console.log('the value of my string will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
  // TODO -> log the actual value of the string to the console
  // TODO -> assign a new value to your variable name
  console.log('the value of my string will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
  // TODO -> log the actual value of the string to the console
```
5. **How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer (i.e., whole number)?**

    1. Declare a variable number and assign the number 7.25 to it.

    2. console.log number.

    3. Declare another variable roundedNumber that has the value of number but rounded to the nearest integer.

    4. console.log number.

    5. So now we have number and roundedNumber find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.

    6. console.log the highest value.

6. **Arrays**

    1. Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. 

    2. Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.

    3. console.log your array.

    4. Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).

    5. Log your array.

    6. Add a statement that adds Syeda’s favorite animal ('kitten') to the existing array.

    7. Log your new array
    

7. **More strings: Let's consider the following string: `let myString = "this is a test"`.**

    1. Add the string to your file and console.log it.

    2. Find a way to get the length of myString.

    3. console.log the length of myString.

8. **If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?**

    1. Add at least 3 console.log statements in which you show that you understand what % does.

9. **Write a program to answer the following questions:**

    1. Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.

    2. Can you compare infinities? Does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?

    3. Add console.log statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).

10. **I’ve declared a multidimensional array (an array inside an array) -- see below. How can I access the third item’s second element? i.e. [2, 1] is the third element, and I want to access 1. Add a console.log statement accessing this item.**
```
const grid = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]];
```


11. **If I have a variable counter, and I want to increment it by 2, what are three ways I can do this? Add three console.log statements with the three different ways.**
```
let counter = 0;
console.log(‘first method’);
```

**12. Here’s a profile about a cat for adoption. 
Create variables to hold information about this cat as shown on the profile. For example:**

```
const name = ‘Prince’;
const bestFriend = ‘Thomas’;
```

**13. Create two variables -- one to hold the names of the kittens and one to hold the names of the adult cats. Make sure to choose an appropriate data type to hold this information!**
