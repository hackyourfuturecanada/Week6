// Q-5: How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer (i.e., whole number)?

//ANSWER

//Declare a variable number and assign the number 7.25 to it.
let number = 7.25;
console.log(number);
// Declare another variable roundedNumber that has the value of number but rounded to the nearest integer.
var roundedNumber = Math.round(7.25);
console.log(+ roundedNumber);

// So now we have number and roundedNumber find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable. Console.log the highest value.
console.log(7.25 > 7);

let highest = 7.25;
console.log(highest);
