// Q-9: Write a program to answer the following questions:

//ANSWERS
// Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.
const favoritesPlacesAndNumbers = ['India','17','Tajikistan','100'];
console.log(favoritesPlacesAndNumbers);
// Can you compare infinities?
console.log('could not answer this question?');
// Does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
let x = 6/0;
let y = 10/0;
console.log(6/0 === 10/0);
// Add console.log statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).
