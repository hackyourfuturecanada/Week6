// Q-6 ARRAYS
// Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element.
const friendNames = [];
//Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
console.log('The Value of the Array is :','Empty');
// console.log your array
console.log(friendNames);
//Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
const favoriteAnimales = ['Lion','Owl','Raccoon'];
//Log your array.
console.log(favoriteAnimales);
// Add a statement that adds Syedaâ€™s favorite animal ('kitten') to the existing array. Log your new array
favoriteAnimales.push('Kitten');
console.log(favoriteAnimales);
